A supervised machine learning project building a multi-output regression that minimizes symmetric Mean Absolute Error (sMAPE) when predicting gold recovery from ore. Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression were tuned and cross-validated to determine which model best minimizes sMAPE on the training set. After identifying the best model, the model is used to determine which factors are unprofitable.
